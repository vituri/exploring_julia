# Vectors

Vectors are one of the fundamental blocks of Julia programming. They are sequences of objects (strings, 
numbers, dates, etc.)

There are many ways to define vectors in Julia.

We can put the numbers 1, 2 and 3 together in a vector as follows:

```{julia}
[1, 2, 3]
```

We can also specify the beginning and ending of the sequence like this:

```{julia}
[1:7;]
```

and we can even go in steps of size different than 1:

```{julia}
[1:2:11;]
```

Note the `;` symbol after 1:7; it is necessary to transform the object into a true vector,
instead of a `range` object. We will talk more about `types` later.

## Problem 

Find the sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 999.

:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Solution

```{julia}
v = [1:2:999;]
sum(v)
```

## List comprehensions

List comprehensions are a nice way to write vectors:

```{julia}
[x^2 for x ∈ 1:5]
```

and they resemble a lot the mathematical notation of sets:

$$
\{x^2 \; \text{for } x \in \{1, \ldots, 5 \} \}
$$

You can specify conditions on list comprehensions:

```{julia}
[x^2 for x ∈ 1:10 if (x % 2 == 0)]
```

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Problem (Project Euler problem 1)

Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$.
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Solution

```{julia}
v = [x for x ∈ 1:999 if (x % 3 == 0 || x % 5 == 0)]
sum(v)
```

## Broadcasting

Broadcast is apply a function to each element of a vector (or iterable object).

Suppose we have this function:

```{julia}
square(x::Integer) = x^2;
```

and 

```{julia}
v = [1:5;]
```

Then we can apply it to each element of a vector in the following ways:

- using list comprehensions:

```{julia}
[square(x) for x ∈ v]
```

- using the `map` operator:

```{julia}
map(square, v)
```

- using the broadcast operator with the dot syntax:

```{julia}
square.(v)
```

For functions that are called by a symbol (like `+`, `^`, etc.) we have to put the dot before the symbol, like this:

```{julia}
[1:5;] .* 5
```

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Problem (Project Euler problem 6)

<p> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
$1^2+ 2 ^2+ \dots + 10^2 = 385.$</p>
<p>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
$(1+ 2+ \dots + 10)^2 = 3025.$</p>
</p>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025-385 = 2640.$</p>

</p> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum. </p>
:::

::: {.callout-tip icon=false}
## Solution

```{julia}
sum(1:100)^2 - sum((1:100).^2)
```

## Operations on vectors

We can do many things with vectors.
